}
\arguments{
\item{list}{with SPSS-commands, the format is supposed to be the same as what is output from spv2sps (a list containing one command per entry, the command being a character vector, and the attribute 'datafile' with a character vector containing the position of the SPSS-data-file \link{incl. path}; if not found at the path, the file is searched in the current directory)}

}
\value{
list with jamovi / jmv-analysis-function-calls and the data set stored in the attribute 'dataset'
